# Horiseon Website Update 2020

I spent this week cleaning up and adding additional accessibility to my client's website. The goal was to improve the company's SEO through the addition of alternate image tags and by improving the html semantic elements.

As you can see, the page looks practically unchanged. However, the added accessibility will greatly improved the companyâ€™s SEO bringing more clients to their site.
